# gCal 2 iCal

A simple site to generate Google Calendar iCal (.ics) links for public calendars. A calendar's .ics link can be used to subscribe to the calendar by many calendar applications.

All Google Calendars have a unique Calendar ID in an email address format. If available publicly, the calendar has an .ics link which follows the format of:

    https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/{CALENDAR_ID}/public/basic.ics

Note: this only works if the owner of the calendar has set the permissions of the calendar to be viewed by the public.
